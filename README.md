# INet
We want to identify general information by building a **Consensus Network** and then to obtain  **case-Specific Networks** one for each layer with the information present only in that layer and not in all the others.

- **MeanJaccardWeighted** to see how distant are the different layers at the beginning
- **ConsensusWeightedJaccardAlgorithm** to create the consensus network
- **SpecificFunction** to create the case specific network
- **ThresholdConsensus** to change only the threshold on the similar layer after the algorithm

*Integration Network Algorithm:*
