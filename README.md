We want to identify general information by building a **Consensus Network** and then to obtain  **Case-Specific Networks** one for each layer with the information present only in that layer and not in all the others.

*Important Functions:*

- **consensusNet** to create the _Consensus Network_
- **specificNet** to create the _Case Specific Network_

- **thresholdNet** to change the threshold of the consensus from the similar layer after the algorithm
- **JWmean** to see how distant are the layers at the beginning
