\usage{
densityNet(graphL)
}
\arguments{
\item{graphL}{the list of weighted graphs in igraph format.}
}

the quantile of the mean density distribution,
the quantile of the mean density distribution without the zeros,
plot density distribution without the zeros
}
\description{
This function creates a density plot of the different graphs mean
weights. It can be used to search the final Threshold for the Consensus
Network starting from similar networks.
