\usage{
measuresNet(graphL, nodes.measures = TRUE)

\arguments{
\item{graphL}{a list of graphs as igraphs objects.}

\item{nodes.measures}{logical, if falso it computes only graph measures, if
true it computes also nodes measures (default TRUE).}
}
\value{
list of measure for each layer.
}
\description{
This function computes graphs and nodes measures to analyse all
 the layers in one shot.
